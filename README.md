This repository contains the R code for our two-part modeling approach used in the EVA 2021 data competition. 
The code "Z_twopart.R" runs the first part of our model, and "BA_CNT_twopart.R" runs the second part of our model.
In order to use the code, please install R package "INLA" and register for the package PARDISO at https://pardiso-project.org/r-inla/.
